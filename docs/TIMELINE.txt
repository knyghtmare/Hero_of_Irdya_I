BW: Before Wesnoth
YW: Years Wesnoth

==Timeline of Irdya==

This is meant to be a list of the historical events of Irdya that took place before the Kingdom of Wesnoth was ever established as well as many events related to the Great Continent and Irdya. It is not official but provides enough details for any curious UMC creator. 

===Locations===

====Great Continent====
This is Irdya's largest known continent. However, only a small portion of it has been explored.

=====The Sandy Wastes=====
This is a great desert that exists between Wesnoth and the Silver Lands. It is rumoured that the Khalifate, a faction of Haldric's people that were separated and compelled to adapt to the barren conditions, may reside in settlements here. However, there is no evidence of their existence.

=====The Silver Lands=====
The community lying to the east of Wesnoth is known as the Silver Lands. At its north, lies the southeastern part of the Lins-Elen (Lintair Forest) and the Eventide cities of Noct and Diurna, a volcano known as the Fire Cloud Peak that is home to the Silver Drakes and Ssyuriss Fenn, a swamp home to the hyena-like Gnolls and saurian tribes. The Bitter Swamp and the Sandy Wastes desert separate this region from Wesnoth. The Triththa Mountains lie at its heart and is the home of the Dwarves of Triththa. Lake Aoir lies to the South and the Minotaur country is situated around this lake.

Explorers say that this may be the eastern edge of the Great Continent, but no evidence has supported their stories...yet. 
 
=====Kingdom of Wesnoth=====

This is the most prominent kingdom in Irdya, almost associated with the entire western part of the Continent. Its capital is Weldyn located at the kingdom's eastern regions. Its most significant city is Dan'Tonk.

[[Geography of Wesnoth]]

=====Elensefar=====

A lorddom near Wesnoth's western border. This city state is sometimes a part of Wesnoth or sometimes considered to be an independent nation. Either way, it has been an ally of Wesnoth almost throughout its history.

=====The Northlands=====
The region lying between the northern shore of the Great River and the south of the Heart Mountains is known as the Northlands. Notable locations include Wesmere Forest, home of the Kalian council, and Dwarven Doors.

=====The Far North=====
The region beyond the Heart Mountains is known as the Far North. This is home mostly to the orcish tribes, although a xenophobic faction of elves reside within the Silent Forest in the aftermath of the First Elven Civil War.

=====The Far South=====
The region that lies beyond the southern border of Wesnoth and the Aethenwood is known as the Far South. There is no factual account of what actually exists here, but many adventurers who had opportunity to explore the region state there is only a vast desert known as the Ashland Desert, which is actually an extension of the Sandy Wastes.
----

====Arkenova====
A vast island, directly west from the Far North region of the Great Continent, and separated from the mainland by the Great Ocean. It is considered by most explorers as a small continent. 
----

====Argea====

The actual name of the continent that is referred in Wesfolk lore as the Old Continent. It is smaller than the Great Continent but, no data has ever confirmed this. This land was where Haldric's people first originated from. The human Empire of Anaktoran was once a glorious empire, stretching from the eastern edge of the continent to the very heart of it. The western parts are orcish homelands and some Minotaurs are also seen in these regions. The Orcs reside in the hills, while the Minotaurs reside in the forests. It is not confirmed what lies at its northern shores but the southern one is the location of a vast forest. Not many things about this forest are known, save for the fact that it is rumoured to be the abode of many strange creatures — abominations and undead-like begins. King Dowrein I, the first king ever to lead an expedition to the forest and survive its ordeal, named the forest the '''Forest of Nightmares'''. The far southern part of this mainland is completely unknown, with no records of it may be situated there. 
----

====The Green Isle====
A large island lying somewhere on the Great Ocean, between the landmasses of Argea and the Great Continent (Argh! Somebody please make a better name this!). It is thought to be the place where the Wose first came into existence (the evidence backing this up is very fragile and thus, could be ignored).

The central and southern area are home to the Isle-folk (Halric's people) — descendants of the refugees from Anaktoran who initially settled there - and over time these Isle-folk settlements had developed into small cities such Southbay, Stormvale and Clearwater. Decades later, the Wesfolk, led by Jevyan, arrive in the northern shores of the Green Isle and a lengthy war is fought between the two sides. The Isle-folk prevail, pushing the Wesfolk to settle in small communities, although two of these settlements developed into cities, namely Jevyan's Haven and Blackmore.

The natives of the Green Isle are seldom encountered and are thought to reside in locations that were never explored before, namely the northern regions, excluding the location of Jevyan's Haven. The very few people who had crossed paths with these natives refer to them as a nobility. Despite the natives demonstrating themselves as a noble race, they remain as minor settlements who are at a fragile peace and wars are common between them. The natives have a taste for herbal remedies, fire magic, and their skills with weapons such as swords, bows and spears are somewhat fascinating. Centuries later, they were eventually called the Aragwaithi.

In the exodus of Haldric's people and the Wesfolk from the Green Isle, only the Aragwaithi remained there, since they were not willing to leave their homeland and most kingdoms went into hiding, to locations where the orcs would seldom look.
----

====Lands of the Icy North====
The northern most landmass of Irdya, or in simple terms, the 'North Pole.' This region has long been the home of the Windsong Foundation however, neither the foundation's exact location nor its existence has been confirmed.
----

====Unknown Landmass====
Located somewhere between the landmasses of Argea and the Great Continent and perpetually surrounded by the endless ocean, the land was divided evenly between two nations - the Celestials and the Ceresians - in a forgotten era. At the heart of the continent, there is a vast mountain which has a legend centred around it. The mythos stated that the remains of Mor-Inal were kept deep inside the core of the mountain however, the legend was largely dismissed by both Ceresians and Celestials.
