This is just my attempt at coding my own
Micro AI

It's called the Boss Micro AI and
its purpose to exhibit behaviour analogous
to a dungeon/scenario boss

What might it do?
1. Wander around a specified area (boss arena)
2. Approach and attack the weakest enemies.
3. Prefer a specific target (typically the player's leader unit)
4. Kill and reset wandering mode
