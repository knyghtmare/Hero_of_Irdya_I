This is just my attempt at coding my own
Custom Micro AI

It's called the Boss Micro AI and
its purpose to exhibit behaviour analogous
to a dungeon/scenario boss

What it does?
1. Makes the 'boss' wander around a specified area (boss arena)
2. If enemy is within the defined area, target weakest enemy.
3. Approach and attack the weakest enemy.
4. Kill and reset to wandering mode.

Future:
1. Prefer a specific target (typically the player's leader unit)
