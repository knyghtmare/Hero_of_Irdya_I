   as player runs out of units to kill
2. S10...make finale have better visual and sound effects
3. Review bonus of S9
4. Review axe item in S10 and perhaps make the wielder a loyal? Or give the unit a special overlay
5. Give unique dialogue in S12 on hero sacrifice
6. S13: give more spacious starting position for Jahin
7. S17A: give spirit bosses 100% drain on melee
8. S13: Alter boss roaming locations to ensure they don't fight each other.
