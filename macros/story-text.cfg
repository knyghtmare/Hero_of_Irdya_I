During our dash towards the Academy, we had met and befriended two mages: Faria and Maliha. As a mage, Maliha had considerable knowledge in healing spells, and as a person, she was friendly and lively. However, it was her friend who had intrigued me the most. Faria was an elementalist and there was a faint air of mystery about her. She had ebony dark hair and wore green robes, which indicated her adeptness in Nature spells. I cannot describe the feeling, but there was this sort of magnetic interaction that drew me towards her.")}

There were many magic casters or mages within the city walls however, the majority of them were preoccupied in their own thoughts and activities to take notice of us. Those that did notice us, greeted us with a brief smile and returned to their tasks. The city itself was a marvellous sight to behold. The architecture of the buildings was breathtaking; each road had a chain of either magic or alchemy shops situated on both sides; however, at the very heart of the city was the Academy. It resembled a massive castle made of marble with towering steeples, arches at every entrance, and huge dragon-like elemental giants stationed at each tower, overlooking the city and the surrounding area.")}

To the far end, four mages stood on elevated pedestals: each mage wearing decorated robes and wielding heavenly staffs, each emanating an aura of a distinct colour. Before I could speak, the masked mage standing on the tallest pedestal began to address us: he introduced himself as Vaddyn, the elemental grandmaster and leader of the Order of Elemental Sorcery. Lastly, he welcomed us to the Academy and then asked us to introduce ourselves. I stepped forward, introduced myself and then each of my friends, recollected my story and finally asked him if he would help us liberate Verdanyn from the vampires.")}

He further added that we were at liberty to stay and learn here for as long as we could since the Academy always welcomed students.")}

        {STORY_PART ( _ "As we walked towards the castle, I had the opportuinty to see that the Minotaur capital closely resembled Verdanyn in its construction and was heavily guarded. It was no doubt that the Minotaurs were a warlike race and I felt at ease, knowing that we were not their enemies. The castle was located at the heart of this mighty city and was, well...it was what a typical castle should look like. Arching towers, reinforced walls, stone engraved paths, banners of Bovinhelm hung from all prominent and veteran guards stationed at every doorway, tower and station. The castle's main hall was a vast room with a huge rectangular table. Each chair at the table was occupied by a noble, general or a prominent high-ranking official of the city. Two seats were kept empty, obviously for General Gerath Toa and myself. At the far end of the table, on the most decorated chair, sat King Rharcyn himself. As we entered the hall, King Rharcyn motioned us to take our seats so that the feast could begin.")}

King Rharcyn was generous enough to offer us information regarding more potential allies.

The scouts also reported that these dwarves were no friend to the vampires and were often seen in skirmishes against the bloodsucking fiends.")}

The second was going through an underground cavern that they called the Realm of Fire. To avoid unnecessary casualties, I opted for the second option.")}
